THESE ARE EXTENSIONS / SCRIPTS FOR MONEYDANCE WRITTEN IN PYTHON (JYTHON 2.7)
The scripts and extensions are identical. The extensions are simply a packaged script version.

The Extensions will only run on Moneydance version 2021 build 2012 onwards... The scripts don't have this requirement
NOTE: You may need to download the MD preview version from: https://infinitekind.com/preview
(If you have installed the extension, but nothing happens, then check your Moneydance version)

Extensions have a file extension of *.mxt
Scripts have a file extension of *.py
If you downloaded a zip file (extension *.zip) then unzip first in a directory of your choice to get at the file(s)

Toolbox is an Extension format only - i.e. just the Toolbox.mxt file
All the others have both Extension (*.mxt) and Script (*.py) formats

HOW DO YOU CHOOSE?
- If you just want to run once and then never again, or very infrequently, choose the Script version.
- If you want the functionality always available from the Moneydance extension menu, choose Extension

To run Extensions:
1) Install the Extension. Load Moneydance, Menu>Extensions>add from file>choose <extension_name>.mxt file
2) Accept the warning that the extension is unsigned / missing (this simply means that Moneydance have not signed / verified my extension). Click Install Extension.
3) Once its installed, restart Moneydance.
4) From now on, just click Menu>Extensions and the name of the Extension

To run Scripts:
1) Load Moneydance. Menu>Window>Show Moneybot Console
2) Open Script>choose <script_name>.py file
3) Click RUN (and not run snippet)
4) That's it.... Repeat these steps each time.
