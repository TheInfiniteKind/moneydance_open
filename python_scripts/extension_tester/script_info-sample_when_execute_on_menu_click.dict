# This is the format to use when using the script methods and you want to execute only on extensions menu click
# Define your main script using {"type" = "menu","script_file" = "scriptname.py", "name" = "Extension Tester"}
# unload.py is recommended. Optionally define 'initializer' script, and also invoke.py, handle_event.py.
# the tag "script_fixed_parameter" is optional and will be passed into the variable 'moneydance_extension_parameter'
# you do not need the ExtensionClass() in this situation
# Rename this file to script_info.dict (and remove these comments)
