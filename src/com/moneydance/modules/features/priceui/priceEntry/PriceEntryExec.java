/*
 * This class contains most of the "model" code 
 * (in the sense of Model-View-Controller)
 * for the app, and (I think) most of the 
 * "controller" code as well.
 * 
 * Note that the PriceTableModel class knows nothing about Moneydance,
 * and should be able to be used with another personal finance package.
 * The same should be true of the PriceEntryScreen class.
 * 
 * However, if one actually wanted to use PriceEntryScreen 
 * and PriceTableModel with a different personal finance program,
 * then further decoupling would be called for.  Those classes should
 * then be moved into a different package.
 * 
 * And PriceEntryScreen shouldn't even know that the "responder" object,
 * to which it delegates responding to significant GUI events,
 * is an instance of this class; it should know it only as implementing
 * an interface, which should live in the same package where it does:
 * "PriceEntryResponder"?
 * 
 * The "main" method of this class, the one which gets everything
 * going, is, um, "go".  It, and the private "initialize*" methods (which it 
 * calls, directly or indirectly) cause the necessary model data to be 
 * fetched from Moneydance, and then cause the "Security Prices" window to be
 * initialized and displayed.
 * 
 * The various "action routines" in the window class, PriceEntryScreen,
 * delegate to methods in this class:
 * 
 * - closeWindow()
 * 
 * - applyPrices()
